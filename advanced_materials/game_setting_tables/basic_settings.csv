Argument,Default value,Description
username,myagent,"The user name used to log in the game. Spaces and underscores are not allowed."
max_turns,1000,"The maximum number of turns per game. The game will end after the turn number reaches this limit."
host,localhost,"The URL that hosts the game."
client_port,6001,"The port to be connected by the client. Used in the single-thread mode. For parallel running, the client port is chosen from available ports."
multiplayer_game,True,"Whether to start a multiplayer game or single-player game."
hotseat_game,False,"Whether to use the hotseat mode in a single-player game."
wait_for_observer,False,"Whether to wait for an observer to join before starting the game. If set to True, the game will not start until a user observes the game through the browser."
server_timeout,30,"The duration in seconds before considering the server as timed out. In pytest, we automatically set it to be 5 in conftest.py."
wait_for_timeout,10000,"Sometimes we perform an invalid action and cannot receive the response to wait_for_packs. We wait for wait_for_timeout seconds and clear the wait_for_packs to prevent the process from sticking."
begin_turn_timeout,30,"Sometimes, the server is stuck for unknown reasons and will not return a begin_turn packet. We wait for begin_turn_timeout seconds before we close the environment. This configuration should be carefully set when playing with human or AI agents because they may take more than 60 seconds for each of their turns. In those cases, the server will send a begin_turn packet only after they finish their turns."
pytest,False,"Whether in pytest mode. In pytest, we automatically set it as True in conftest.py."
score_window,10,"The number of episode scores maintained in the ParallelTensorEnv."
aifill,4,"The number of AI players to be initialized when a game starts."
maxplayers,10,"The maximum number of players allowed to join a game."
self_play,True,"Whether to start multiple clients for self-play. When it is true, the following clients will add an increasing index to their username for login to the same game. Note that when running pytest, we automatically set this as False. By doing so, different tests connecting to the same port will raise an exception and force one test to re-select a random new port."
minp,1,"The minimum number of players needed for starting a game."
allowtake,"HAhadOo","Decides whether one can take control/observe a player. Please check the details of this setting in the Freeciv instruction."
autotoggle,disabled,"Whether to allow an AI to control a player when the previous player disconnects."
endvictory,enabled,"Whether to end the game when some players succeed under victory conditions. Options: enabled, disabled."
victories,"SPACERACE|ALLIED","Victory condition options: SPACERACE|ALLIED|CULTURE. If a certain victory condition is not set, the calculation logic for that victory condition will be skipped."
openchatbox,enabled,"Whether to open the chatbox in the web interface. Options: enabled, disabled."
ruleset,classic,"The ruleset to be used."
runner_type,"parallel","The type of runner."
